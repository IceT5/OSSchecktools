# OSSchecktools
Provide some tools for inspection work in the open source software field.

## Copyright extraction tools
When we introduce other open-source projects into our project, we need to make corresponding declarations. During the declaration, we need to extract the copyright information of the open-source projects. This tool can automatically extract all copyright information from open-source projects and remove duplicates.

You can see more details at [Copyright_extraction](Copyright_extraction).
